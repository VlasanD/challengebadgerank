One important aspect of this application is the user profile, 
which includes key information such as the user's username, 
their current tokens, ongoing challenges, and earned badges.

The fitness challenges have a daily minimum requirement that 
must be met and are carried out over a specific time period,
starting from a designated start date and ending on a finish date.
Users can earn badges upon completing these challenges.
Tokens can be earned by achieving the first, second, or third place in the challenge.
The ranking is based on the highscores.

It is a REST API using Postman to test it, 
but I have written a HTML/CSS code for further frontend implementation
